Module 3 - Revision

1. What is a neural network.Compare this with biological neurans.

Layers - 
Input layer - each cell/pixel
Hidden layer - identify the features
Output layer - binary classification/multi class classification


2. Difference between Machine learning and neural network(deep learning)

Features are to be provided by us
Input with output
neural network - net work is basically identifies the 
patterns

3. Write diagram of an ANN and label various parts

4. How artificial neural network learns

5. Types of neural networks. Explain 
6. Applications of neural networks. Advantage and disadvantage
7. Back propagation
8. Activation functions
9. Gradient descent - 
minimize the loss

Expected - Actual =loss
Minimize loss
partial derivative
